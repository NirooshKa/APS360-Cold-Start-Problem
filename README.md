# APS360-Cold-Start-Problem

## Rules

1. **Academic integrity is top priority.** Any cheating/copying will get you kicked out of the group.

2. Use GitHub's "issues" for discussion about the software stuff, and to keep track of progress.

3. Everything should be in the readme file, or this repository, unless if it's a docx file.

4. For source code on GitHub, use .py files. If necessary, we will first start with a Jupyter notebook in the Google drive folder, and then, convert it to .py, and then push to github.  

## Project Overview

Subject: Multiple objects detection in a single image

## Project Management

1. Use Google Colab for final presentation;
2. Use python source files for actual code;
3. Put docx, pdf etc. into Google Drive folder (link: ?)

## Project Ideas

1. Hand Gesture Recognition (See [Leap Motion](https://www.ultraleap.com/))
2. Some sort of Biomedical application
3. Sign Language
4. Facial and voice recognition
5. ANN for ANN Parameters optimization (hyperparameter optimization)
6. ANN optimizer (backward pass) using Genetic Algorithm.
7. Human Face Detection

**8. Multiple objects detection in a single image** -> Final Decision

9. Neural Style Transfer
